# Deep-Learning-Mini-Projects
A small repository of some easily implementable deep learning projects for beginners

## Artistic Neural Network
A very popular method for stylizing images using neural network.

## RNN - Pure Numpy
A very simple yet amazing implementation of Vanilla RNN using basic Numpy functionalities. Original Work Link :- [Link](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086)

## LSTM - Pure Numpy 
Simple Numpy implementation of Long Short Term Memory. (Without comments as of now). The code is buggy (well, not actually), extremely slow to train and does not give very nice ouputs as of now. Suggestions are welcome.

## Time Series Prediction using LSTM
A very simple implementation to just get idea about how LSTM can be used for Time Series prediction. Original Work Link : [Blog](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-long-short-term-memory-network-python/)
